## How to define define components

An example of how to define a component in JSX can be found in HelloWorld.jsx. When creating a new page you can add your component to the index.js file and a temporary routinglink in the App.jsx file to be able to access your page.

Generally we want to follow the advice given here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vitejs/plugin-vue-jsx  and i propose we stick to the 4:th definition all the time just to make the code more coherrent.
